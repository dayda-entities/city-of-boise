<DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;font-size:12pt"><P STYLE="font-size:16ptmargin:7 0 7 0;"><SPAN><SPAN>This is a point data set of fire hydrants managed by Boise City. The term 'managed' is used in this data set to denote that Boise City maintains a mapped location of the fire hydrant to satisfy needs identified in the purpose section of this metadata. A fire hydrant is any fixture designed to enable firefighters to tap into the water distribution system to assist in extinguishing a fire. In the Boise region these are typically the traditional above ground cast iron hydrants (generally red) with a cap and valves. This data set also includes atypical hydrants such as the underground access points as found at the Boise Airport. This data set was created by Boise City GIS beginning in 2008 based on available information from United Water, Ada County, Garden City, Meridian, and hardcopy maps maintained by Boise Fire. The data is currently updated via GPS and heads-up digitizing (when GPS data is not available). This dataset is continually updated as new hydrants are installed and location or attribute errors are corrected. The data set is current to the last date of publication. This data set contains all fire hydrants in the following locales: 1) Boise City Limits/Boise Fire District and enclaves; 2) Whitney Fire District and enclaves; 3) North Ada County Fire and Rescue (NACFR) Fire District excluding Garden City; and 4) the general area five miles south and east of the Boise area of impact that are not within a fire district. No data is collected for the following areas: 1) Garden City limits or Garden City area of impact; 2) Kuna fire district; 3) Meridian fire district; and 4) Eagle fire district</SPAN></SPAN></P></DIV>
