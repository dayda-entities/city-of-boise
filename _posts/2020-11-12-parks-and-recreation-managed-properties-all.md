is a polygon data set representing City of Boise Parks and
Recreation data. A park is generally an area of land in a largely natural
state, sometimes with grass, trees, paths, sports fields, playgrounds, picnic
areas and other facilities, that is set aside and managed specifically for
recreation use and enjoyment by the public. The features included in this
polygon feature class are: parks, reserves, city maintained cemeteries, city
maintained road rights-of-ways and greenbelt areas. </span><span style='font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;'></span></font></p>
