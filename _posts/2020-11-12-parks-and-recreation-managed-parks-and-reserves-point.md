A park is generally an area of land in a largely natural state, sometimes with grass, trees, paths, sports fields, playgrounds, picnic areas and other facilities, that is set aside and managed specifically for recreation use and enjoyment by the public. A reserve is a place set aside for special use.  In this case, reserves are lands set aside and protected from future development for the enjoyment of the public as well as a haven for wildlife.</span><div style='font-size: 17px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;'><br /></div><div style='font-size: 17px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;'>This data set was created from a combination of Boise Parks and Recreation park and facility files and the Ada County Parcel records.
