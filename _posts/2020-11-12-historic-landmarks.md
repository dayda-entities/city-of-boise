This is a polygon data set depicting sites designated by the <b>City of Boise</b> as historic local landmarks and sites registered as historic by the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within Boise's Area of Impact. Historic landmarks are defined as sites, buildings, structures or objects that possess exceptional significance in history, architecture, engineering, archaeology or culture at the local level and have been designated as an historic landmark through either the public hearing process as defined by the Boise City Historic Preservation Code, <a href='https://cityclerk.cityofboise.org/media/262806/1100.pdf' target='_blank'>Title 11 Section 05-09</a> of the City Code, or by being listed on the NRHP. The historic landmark polygons represent the area (building(s), parcel(s), or feature(s)) of historic significance for a given site. <div><br /></div><div>This data set was developed by Boise Planning and Development Services (PDS) staff based on available documentation of the landmark's representative area. Historic local landmarks are established by City of Boise ordinances; these sites may or may not also be registered as national historic landmarks. Properties that have historic landmarks present are regulated for all building and demolition permits in order to protect the City's historic resources. This data is updated as changes occur to the national registry and the local landmark listing for Boise.</div><div><br /></div><div>For more information, please visit <a href='https://pds.cityofboise.org/planning/hp/' target='_blank'><b>City of Boise Planning and Development Services</b></a>.</div>
