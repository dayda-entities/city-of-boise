These sub-areas are defined by physical barriers and/or the character of existing developments within them, and may each have specific planning objectives and policies articulated in the Comprehensive Plan."

Collectively, the polygons represent the geography for the Boise City large scale comprehensive planning area.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P><P><SPAN>This data set is a critical component of the official Land Use Map within the Boise City Comprehensive Plan. It is used to identify specific areas within Boise City and the Boise Area of Impact to which specific land use designations and policies are applied.
