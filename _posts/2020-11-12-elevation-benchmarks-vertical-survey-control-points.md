This is a point data set representing monumented vertical geodetic survey control points (a.k.a. elevation benchmarks) established by the <b>City of Boise</b>. A benchmark is a physical marker, monument, or demarcation established by a surveyor for horizontal and/or vertical measurement control. This data set only contains benchmarks established by the City of Boise that are based on the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88); benchmarks established under other vertical datums are not included. The elevation values in this data set are based on the vertical control from the National Geodetic Survey (NGS), the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), and some state owned vertical control. The horizontal location is obtained by Global Positioning System (GPS) data collection of the surveyed benchmark. Attribute data including elevation, is transcribed from surveying field books supplied by Boise City Public Works survey personnel. <div><br /></div><div><b><i>Data Attributes:</i></b></div><div><b>MARK TYPE: </b>ALCAP - Aluminum Cap, BRASSCAP - Brass Cap, CHISELSQ - physically carved square, PK - A steel masonry nail manufactured by Parker Kaelon (PK nail), OTHER - Any other survey marker type.</div><div><b>LOCATION: </b>Nearest street or cross streets to the benchmark.</div><div><b>ELEVATION: </b>The vertical elevation in feet above sea level as established from survey calculations based on the 1988 NAVD Datum.</div><div><b>GPS DATE: </b>Date the benchmark was captured by GPS.</div><div><b>COMMENTS: </b>Pertinent notes on general description and location of the benchmark.</div><div><b>BOOK: </b>The City of Boise Public Works surveying field book number the benchmark was established under.</div><div><b>PAGE: </b>The City of Boise Public Works surveying field book page the benchmark was established under.</div><div><div><br /></div><div>The data set is maintained by the Boise City Public Works GIS staff.
