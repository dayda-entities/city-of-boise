A park planning area is a Boise City political boundary used for several administrative purposes including: facilitating fee collections and park developments, and ensuring that park fees collected in a specific park planning area are applied to that park planning area. The park planning area boundaries subdivide the Boise City Area of Impact based on demographics, geography, and characteristics of a localized area, as determined by Boise Parks and Recreation officials. </div><div style='font-size: 17px; font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;'><br /></div><div style='font-size: 17px; font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;'>The Park Plan data set is used for a number of purposes related to planning efforts by the Parks and Recreation department and the development permitting process. The Boise Municipal Code Section 4-12-13 (Park and Recreation Impact Fees) allows Boise City to establish impact fees for Parks and Recreation. A portion of the fees charged for building permits are based upon which park planning area an address falls within. Fees are collected by the Planning and Development Services (PDS) Department at the time of building permit issuance and dedicated to be spent for building and maintaining parks within the specific park planning area against which the fees were charged.</div><div style='font-size: 17px; font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;'><br /></div><div style='font-size: 17px; font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;'>This data set is continually being updated.
