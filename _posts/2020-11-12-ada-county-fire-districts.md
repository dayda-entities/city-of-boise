<DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;font-size:12pt"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>This is a polygon data set representing fire district service areas within Ada County, Idaho. Fire districts are the administrative boundaries that define the area that a fire department, or contracted agency, is charged to provide fire suppression services for. It aggregates fire tax code area boundaries for fire districts and incorporated municipalities, as appropriate for the fire agency, to depict the service areas (a.k.a. districts) for each fire department/agency in Ada County. A fire district that annexes an area in June is responsible to serve that area even though taxation is not assigned to those properties until January the next calendar year. This data set does not represent areas of service defined through other agreements such as automatic aid, mutual aid, or other contractual agreements. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P><P><SPAN>This data set is not to be used to identify the tax district boundaries for any fire district/agency. The Idaho State Tax Commission publishes the official tax code area boundaries for all taxing districts (counties, cities, schools, libraries, recreation districts, fire protection, ambulance, hospital, mosquito abatement, and others) once a year (typically in March or April).  </SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P><P><SPAN>This data set is maintained by Boise City GIS and is update at least twice a year (January and July). The data set is current to the date it was published.  </SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P><P><SPAN>For more information, please visit </SPAN><A href="https://fire.cityofboise.org/" STYLE="text-decoration:underline;"><SPAN>City of Boise Fire Department</SPAN></A><SPAN>.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
