Ada County Assessor's Office maintains the dataset of city limits and impact areas within Ada County. Impact areas depict the unincorporated areas of Ada County surrounding each city as identified in Tilte 9 of the Ada County COde, in accordance with Idaho Code Section 67-6526. City boundaries are determined by taxcode and maintained continually, adding areas annexed to city limits by current ordinances.
