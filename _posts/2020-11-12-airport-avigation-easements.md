This is a polygon data
set representing the Avigation Easements held by the <b>City of Boise</b> Airport. (An
easement is an interest in land owned by another that entitles its holder to a
specific limited use or enjoyment.) Avigation Easements are easements granted
by the landowner to the Airport for the right to use the airspace above the
property without any liability for noise, vibrations, fumes, dust or fuel
particles that may be caused by aircraft. Avigation Easements also grant that
no use of the properties encompassed in the easement area shall be permitted
that would cause discharge into the air of fumes, dust or smoke that would
interfere with aircraft operation. Also, no development or construction shall
be permitted above the height limitations provided by the Boise Airport
 Ordinances.Â <div><br /></div><div>This data was created from the Avigation Easement legal deeds as
 recorded by the Ada County Recorder. This data
set is updated at the request of Boise Airport Administration staff as official
 changes occur. All avigation easements have been acquired through local land
use ordinances. This data was created by POWER Engineers, Inc. and will be 
maintained by the City of Boise. It is current to the date of publication.<div><br /></div><div>For more information, please contact the<a href='https://www.iflyboise.com/contact-us/' target='_blank'> <b>City of Boise Airport</b></a>.</div></div>
