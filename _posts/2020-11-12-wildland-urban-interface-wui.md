<DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;font-size:12pt"><DIV><P><SPAN>This is a polygon data set depicting the areas designated by the City of Boise as Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI). WUI is defined as the area where structures and other human development meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland. These areas have an increased likelihood that wildfires will threaten structures and people. The purpose of the dataset is to define areas with higher wildfire risk and subject those areas to increased FIREWISE standards for development.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P><P><SPAN>As a result of the Oregon Trail Heights fire in the late summer of 2008, the City Council passed </SPAN><A href="https://www.cityofboise.org/city_clerk/033010/o-7-10.pdf" STYLE="text-decoration:underline;"><SPAN>Ordinance # 0-7A-10 </SPAN></A><SPAN>adopting the new regulations for the WUI into the Cityâ€™s fire code in early 2010. The ordinance establishes a range of responses including new fire code standards for construction, fuels mitigation and education in WUI areas. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P></DIV></DIV>
