In 2001, Boise voters passed a levy to fund conservation efforts in the Boise Foothills. The funds are used to protect open space lands through acquisitions, donations, conservation easements, or land exchanges with a focus on critical habitat, riparian corridors, rare plants, historic sites, and potential trail connections.

This map contains polygon data representing all the real properties acquired or protected by the foothills levy funds. Most polygons follow parcel boundaries, but in a few cases where parcel data could not be acquired, generalized boundaries were digitized. The properties could have been purchased, exchanged, or granted conservation easements. Ownership can change as long as the protection stays intact. <div><br /></div><div>The polygon dataset was developed by City of Boise GIS staff under direction of the Boise Parks &amp; Recreation Foothills and Open Space Manager.  The data is maintained by the City of Boise and updated at the request of Boise Parks &amp; Recreation staff, as changes to the data occur.</div><div><br /></div><div>For more information about the Foothills and Open Space Programs, please visit <a href='https://parks.cityofboise.org/open-space/' target='_blank'>City of Boise Parks &amp; Recreation</a>.</div>
