This is a polygon data set representing the officially registered neighborhood associations for <b>City of Boise</b> within the city Area of Impact as identified in <a href='https://pds.cityofboise.org/media/114868/blueprintboise.pdf' target='_blank'>Chapter 3: Community Structure and Design of the Boise Blueprint - Boise's Comprehensive Plan</a>. Neighborhood Associations are non-profit organizations primarily composed of land owners representing areas of Boise with a distinct ‘style’ or ‘character’ (unique: topography, architecture, history of development, goals) with rights to participate in and influence decisions effecting the development, growth, and maintenance of their defined areas; areas collectively identified as neighborhoods. Each neighborhood has a documented plan with the City of Boise and exists entirely within the current Boise area of impact. <div><br /></div><div>This data set was originally created by COMPASS, a regional planning agency for Ada and Canyon County. The data set is now maintained by the City of Boise GIS team. This data set is updated as changes occur and represents a snapshot of the current neighborhood association areas.</div><div><br /></div><div>For more information, please visit <a href='https://energize.cityofboise.org/neighborhoods/neighborhood-planning/' target='_blank'><b>City of Boise Energize Our Neighborhoods</b></a>.</div>
