This is a point data set representing the locations where <b>City of Boise Risk Management and Safety Services</b> has placed automated external defibrillators (AED) for use, if needed, by Boise City staff or the public. An AED is a portable electronic device, that automatically diagnoses potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias in a patient, and is able to treat them through defibrillation (the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to reestablish an effective rhythm). Some locations have an AED placed there seasonally, while other locations have AEDs year round, as noted in the attributes. Only those AEDs positioned for use by general staff and/or the public are recorded in this data set; AEDs not available for use are not included. <div><br /></div><div>The data is a snapshot of AED locations current to the last periodic update. The dataset is maintained by City of Boise GIS under direction from the Boise City’s Risk Management and Safety Services staff.</div><div><br /></div><div>For more information, please contact<b> </b><a href='https://hr.cityofboise.org/contact-us/' target='_blank'><b>City of Boise Risk Management and Safety Services</b>.</a></div>
